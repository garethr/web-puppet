A tiny ruby rack application which exposes the data from puppet as JSON over HTTP.

    gem install web-puppet

Provides a simple command line tool which runs a built in web server. On accessing
the specified port you should get a JSON response containing the current node information.

    web-puppet --help
    Usage: web-puppet [options] ...

    Configuration options:
            --no-daemonize               Don't daemonize the web server process
        -p, --port PORT                  The port to run web-facter on
        -c, --config FILE                The file to load with configuration options
        -h, --help                       Display this screenp

Note that in most setups the yaml directory containing the node information isn't readable
by all users, so you may need to run this as puppet or root.

You can configure web-puppet using a configuration file, using the following format, and
specifying the filename with the --config option above.

    username=gilbert
    password=george
    port=3009
    daemonize=true

Note that the port and daemonize options will override those on the command line.
The username and password options enable HTTP basic authentication using those details.
