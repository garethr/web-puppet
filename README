A tiny ruby rack application which exposes the data from puppet as JSON over HTTP.

    gem install web-puppet

Provides a simple command line tool which runs a built in web server. On accessing
the specified port you should get a JSON response containing the current node information.

    web-puppet --help
    Usage: web-puppet [options] ...

    Configuration options:
            --no-daemonize               Don't daemonize the web server process
        -p, --port PORT                  The port to run web-puppet on

    Common options:
        -h, --help                       Display this screen

Note that in most setups the yaml directory containing the node information isn't readable
by all users, so you may need to run this as puppet or root.
